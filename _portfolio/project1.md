This Studebaker underwent a meticulous frame-off restoration in our workshop. The client requested a period-correct restoration that maintained the vehicle's original character while ensuring reliable performance for regular driving enjoyment.

The project included a full engine rebuild, transmission overhaul, complete interior restoration with correct materials and patterns, and a flawless exterior finish. Every component was either restored or replaced with authentic parts to maintain the vehicle's historical integrity.
