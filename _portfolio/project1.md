This 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback underwent a meticulous frame-off restoration in our workshop. The client requested a period-correct restoration that maintained the vehicle's original character while ensuring reliable performance for regular driving enjoyment.

The project included a full engine rebuild of the original 390 V8, transmission overhaul, complete interior restoration with correct materials and patterns, and a flawless exterior finish in the factory Highland Green. Every component was either restored or replaced with authentic parts to maintain the vehicle's historical integrity.
