This remarkable Corvette came to us in need of a complete restoration. The client desired to maintain the vehicle's historical significance while incorporating subtle modern upgrades for improved drivability.

Our team conducted extensive research to ensure historical accuracy while discreetly integrating modern cooling, electrical, and braking systems. The tubular frame was meticulously repaired, and the iconic body was restored to concours condition. The original engine was completely rebuilt with period-correct specifications.

The stunning exterior finish is complemented by a meticulously crafted interior using materials that match the original specifications but offer improved durability.
