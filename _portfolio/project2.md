This remarkable 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing came to us in need of a complete restoration. The client desired to maintain the vehicle's historical significance while incorporating subtle modern upgrades for improved drivability.

Our team conducted extensive research to ensure historical accuracy while discreetly integrating modern cooling, electrical, and braking systems. The tubular frame was meticulously repaired, and the iconic body was restored to concours condition. The original 3.0L straight-six engine was completely rebuilt with period-correct specifications.

The stunning silver exterior finish is complemented by a meticulously crafted red leather interior using materials that match the original specifications but offer improved durability.
