This exquisite Chevelle underwent a painstaking restoration process to bring it to concours-level condition. Working closely with experts, we ensured every detail was authenticated and restored to factory specifications.

The project involved complete disassembly and documentation of all components, with the engine rebuilt by our certified technicians. The bodywork required extensive sheet metal fabrication to address decades of deterioration while maintaining the original panels whenever possible.

The final result is a flawless example of this iconic American classic in its original color with a meticulously restored interior.
