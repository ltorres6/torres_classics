This beautiful 1963 Jaguar E-Type Series 1 Roadster received a sympathetic restoration focused on preserving its originality while improving reliability and performance for regular road use.

The inline 6-cylinder engine was fully rebuilt with upgraded cooling and electronic ignition for improved reliability. The suspension was upgraded with modern components that maintain the original geometry but provide enhanced handling characteristics. The braking system received modern upgrades while retaining a period-correct appearance.

The original British Racing Green finish was meticulously recreated using modern materials for superior durability, and the tan leather interior was restored using correct materials and stitching patterns.
