This iconic 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 LS6 came to us as a numbers-matching example in need of a complete restoration. Our client wanted to preserve the car's raw muscle car character while ensuring it was mechanically sound and visually stunning.

Our team meticulously rebuilt the original 454ci LS6 V8 engine to factory specifications, producing an authentic 450 horsepower. The Turbo 400 automatic transmission was fully rebuilt and the 12-bolt rear end was restored with the original 4.10 gears.

The body was stripped to bare metal and restored to factory specifications with the iconic Cranberry Red paint and white racing stripes. The black interior was completely restored with NOS and reproduction parts to ensure authenticity.
