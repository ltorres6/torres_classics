This rare 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 underwent an exhaustive factory-authentic restoration to bring it back to its original glory. As one of only 1,580 examples ever produced, meticulous attention to originality was paramount throughout the restoration process.

Working with Porsche's historical archives, we verified all numbers and specifications to ensure complete authenticity. The 2.7-liter flat-six engine was rebuilt to factory specifications, delivering the iconic 210 horsepower that made this model legendary. The restoration included a complete overhaul of the five-speed manual transmission and limited-slip differential.

The distinctive "ducktail" rear spoiler and widened wheel arches were carefully restored, and the car was finished in its original Light Yellow (Hellgelb) color with green Carrera side graphics. The minimalist black interior was restored using correct materials, maintaining the car's focus on lightweight performance.
